This is step 1 of 3 in the Conos pipeline. This module will read single cell data (e.g., count files) from different datasets and project each of those datasets into their own PCA space.

The module ends by saving some variables to file:
```
# Save an object to a file
saveRDS(list(con=con,con_space=con_space), "conos_preprocess_output.rds")
print('saved conos_preprocess_output.rds')
```
## Technical note:
This module uses the Conos Docker container vpetukhov/conos:version-1.4.4 wrapped in the container genepattern/conos:2.1
